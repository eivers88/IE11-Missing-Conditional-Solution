IE11-Missing-Conditional-Solution
=================================

A solution for the missing conditional statements in IE11

This solution was inspired by this current limitation of IE11: http://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/details/806767/conditional-comments-do-not-work-when-emulating-document-modes-via-f12-developer-tools

This solution will not fix all conditional statements in your html document. It is designed to set IE classes on the html tag similar to many of the popular boilerplates out there.

See Example

Make sure to add IE11_Conditional_Fix.js in the head before all other scripts
